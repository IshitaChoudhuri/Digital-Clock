# Digital-Clock
This README file provides an overview and instructions for a digital clock implemented in Python. The digital clock displays the current time in a 24-hour format, including hours, minutes, and seconds.

# Prerequisites
Before running the digital clock program, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
# Getting Started
To set up and run the digital clock program, follow these steps:

  1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.

  2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

  3. Install any necessary dependencies by running the following command:

      Copy code
        `pip install tkinter`
  4. Run the digital clock program by executing the following command:
     Copy code
          `python digitalclock.py`
  5. The digital clock will now start running and display the current time in the console.
 
# Customization
If you want to customize the appearance or behavior of the digital clock, you can modify the `digitalclock.py` file. Here are some possible modifications you can make:

Change the display format: The clock currently displays time in a 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS). You can modify the update_time function in `digitalclock.py` to display time in a different format, such as a 12-hour format.

Add graphical user interface (GUI): If you want to create a GUI-based digital clock, you can use Python libraries like Tkinter or PyQT to build a windowed application with a clock display.

Implement additional features: You can extend the functionality of the digital clock by adding features such as an alarm, a stopwatch, or a countdown timer. You can explore Python libraries like datetime, time, or pyttsx3 to implement these features.

# Contributions
Contributions to the digital clock program are welcome. If you find any bugs, issues, or want to add new features, please submit a pull request or create an issue on the project's repository.

# Acknowledgments
The digital clock program was developed with reference to various Python programming resources and examples available online. Special thanks to the Python community for their valuable contributions and support.
